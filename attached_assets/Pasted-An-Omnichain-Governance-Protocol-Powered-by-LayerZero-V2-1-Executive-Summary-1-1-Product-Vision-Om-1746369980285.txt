An Omnichain Governance Protocol Powered by LayerZero V2

1. Executive Summary
1.1 Product Vision
OmniGovern DAO enables decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) to propose, vote, and execute governance decisions natively across 10+ blockchains. By leveraging LayerZero V2’s omnichain messaging protocol, it solves fragmentation in multi-chain governance while reducing gas costs by 90% compared to single-chain solutions.

1.2 Key Innovations
Chain-Agnostic Governance: Create proposals on Ethereum, vote on Polygon, execute on Arbitrum – all within a unified interface.

Unified Token Supply: OFT-standard governance tokens maintain consistent supply across chains via LayerZero’s burn/mint mechanics.

Atomic Cross-Chain Execution: Approve multi-chain actions (e.g., parameter updates, treasury transfers) in a single transaction using lzCompose.

2. Objectives & Success Metrics
2.1 Business Goals
Goal	Metric	Target
Reduce governance fragmentation	% of DAOs using >3 chains	65% adoption by Q3 2026
Lower voting costs	Avg gas cost per vote	≤$0.10
Accelerate execution	Time to execute cross-chain proposal	≤5 minutes
2.2 Technical Goals
Support 10 EVM chains at launch (Ethereum, Polygon, Base, etc.)

Achieve 99.9% message delivery success rate via LayerZero

Process 100+ cross-chain votes/hour during peak loads

3. User Personas & Use Cases
3.1 Target Users
Persona	Pain Points	OmniGovern Solution
Multi-Chain DAO Member	High Ethereum gas fees for voting	Vote on low-cost chains (Polygon/Base)
Protocol Developer	Manual cross-chain deployments	Atomic parameter updates across chains
Treasury Manager	Fragmented liquidity across chains	Unified OFT token with single supply
3.2 Key Use Cases
Cross-Chain Parameter Voting

Example: Adjust lending rates on Aave Ethereum and Aave Polygon simultaneously.

Omnichine Treasury Management

Move funds from Ethereum to Arbitrum while locking collateral on Base.

Gas-Optimized Governance

User on Polygon pays $0.02 gas to vote on Ethereum-based Uniswap proposal.

4. Product Features
4.1 Core Modules
4.1.1 OFT Governance Token
Functionality:

Unified supply via LayerZero OFT standard

Dynamic bridging fees (0.1% default, adjustable via governance)

Technical Specs:

text
contract GovernanceOFT is OFTAdapterV2, ERC20Votes {  
    uint256 public bridgeFee;  
    function sendFrom(address _from, uint16 _dstChainId, bytes calldata _toAddress, uint256 _amount) external payable override {  
        require(_amount * bridgeFee <= msg.value, "Insufficient fee");  
        super.sendFrom(_from, _dstChainId, _toAddress, _amount);  
    }  
}  
4.1.2 Cross-Chain Governor
Workflow:

Proposal created on any chain

7-day voting period across all chains

LayerZero-aggregated votes trigger execution

Security:

3/5 DVN threshold for critical proposals

24-hour timelock for Ethereum executions

4.1.3 Gas Abstraction Layer
Mechanism:

Users pay gas on low-cost chains

Executor contracts refund gas on destination chains

Configuration:

typescript
// gas-tank.config.ts  
export default {  
  ethereum: { maxGas: 0.1 ETH },  
  polygon: { maxGas: 0.01 MATIC }  
}
